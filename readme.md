## Starting A New Book for Python Learning

This repo is based on the assignments I have completed during learning the Python language.

All the assignments are from the book "Pythong Crash Course 3rd Edition: A Hands On, Project-Based Introduction to Programming by Eric Matthes".

This book is covered by Sir Qasim, on the YouTube channel of Panaverse. (Panaversity Urdu)

BTW thanks Eric for this amazing book ðŸ’˜.
